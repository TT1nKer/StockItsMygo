## 2. Anomaly-Based Opportunities

**Philosophy**: Not predicting direction, only identifying structural anomalies

**Core Principle**: Worth risking -1R when 3 factors align:
- Volatility anomaly (TR/ATR > 2x)
- Volume spike (Volume/MA > 1.5x)
- Clear structure (Stop loss naturally exists)

*No anomalies detected today (market behaving normally)*
